Oh, hey there!
Welcome to Artist IQ!
I'm Lilime (pronounced: lil-e-meh).
Artist IQ is about training your senses and dexterity.
Don't worry, it will be fun!
Dexterity and sensing is good for artists to have.
However, it's also good for ordinary people to have in their everyday life.
Each level has a different theming and way to play.
That's why I recommend doing the tutorial in each level first;
especially if you are unsure what to do.
Shall we get started?
Let's go!
